## Citi Bike Profit Optimization

This repository contains the code and analysis for a term project focusing on improving the profitability of Citi Bike, a shared bicycle system in New York City, through data-driven strategies.

### Summary

The project explores various factors influencing Citi Bike usage demand and operational efficiency. Key findings and methodologies include:

- **Factors Influencing Demand**: Analyzed factors such as proximity to workplaces, low-income households, educational institutions, and recreational facilities, revealing their impact on borrowing volume.
- **Modeling and Predictions**: Developed regression models to predict borrowing volume and demand for resources, including parking docks and full-time dispatchers.
- **Weather Impact Analysis**: Investigated the relationship between weather variables, traffic flow, and borrowing volume, utilizing linear regression and time series LSTM models.
- **Dynamic Bonus Point System**: Implemented a system to dynamically adjust bonus points for user assistance in vehicle scheduling based on predicted borrowing volume.
- **Optimizing Schedules**: Used weather and time data to refine schedules for full-time dispatchers, minimizing labor costs while maximizing operational efficiency.

### Future Research Suggestions

While the project offers valuable insights, there are several areas for further exploration:

- **Data Limitations**: Addressing limitations such as insufficient information on parking dock vacancies and weather data coverage to enhance model accuracy.
- **Expanding Scope**: Considering Citi Bike data outside Manhattan and analyzing network relationships between station locations.
- **Automation Tools**: Developing automated tools combining proposed models and methods to increase operational efficiency further.

For detailed information, refer to the project documentation and analysis reports.

### Repository Structure

- **Code**: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, modeling, and predictions.
- **Data**: Includes datasets used for analysis, such as Citi Bike borrowing data and weather data.
- **Reports**: Contains project documentation, analysis reports, and presentation slides.
